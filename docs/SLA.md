# Service Level Agreement (SLA) for MiniTwit API
This SLA defines the guarantees provided by the MiniTwit API provided by this enterprise. The agreement is active between the provider of the MiniTwit API and any third-party entity who might use the service in any way, shape, or form.

## Service Availability
We guarantee that the service will be available 99% of the time during any month. This metric is defined by comparing actual service availability with the theoretical service availability during this month.

## Scheduled Maintenance
The MiniTwit API may experience sessions of maintenance. These periods will be announced at least 24 hours in advance, and will be preferred to be on low-traffic hours. Total maintenance time will not exceed more than 4 hours per month.

## Response Time
The MiniTwit API will try to respond to any request within 100 milliseconds. The MiniTwit API will be monitored to ensure response times are kept below this metric.

## Support
We will provide email and ticket-based support. We will respond to any requests within a week.

## Security
Security of our system is done through system security assessments, pen-testing, and following industry-standard security practices. Any discovered security breaches will be transparently made public.

## Data Backup
The system data is backed up via Digital Oceanâ€™s managed database, and the systems they have in place to ensure data backup.

## Limitations
The SLA defined here does not account for events outside of our control, like blackouts, natural disasters, as well as the unavailability of third party services. If we suspect any third-party user from abusing the MiniTwit API or breaking agreements, their rates will be throttled.

## Amendments
We reserve the right to amend this SLA at any point of time. Any third-party entity who might use the service will be made aware of changes 30 days in advance.
